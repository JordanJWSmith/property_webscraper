It is located on a quiet and prestigious crescent Between the Commons, close to good schools, Clapham Common and its tennis courts and only 500 m from Clapham South’s Northern Line tube station.</p><p></p><p>Old Park Avenue is an exclusive address. The street, constructed in the early 1890s, is mostly made up of handsome and substantial semi-detached properties, plus two impressive detached properties, one of which is double-fronted – this one. This unique property, built in Queen Anne revival style, boasts an outstanding frontage of 45’ - a lateral width which will set most buyers’ pulses racing - and a wonderfully large and sunny, south-west facing, rear garden (62’ x 45’), about which most buyers’ children can only usually dream.</p><p></p><p>Once inside, the property continues to seriously impress - arranged around a welcomingly wide entrance hall, with marvellous galleried staircase, are the three receptions, all with high ornate ceilings, lovely large windows, original marble fireplaces and hardwood floors; two are very large and sit at the front, either side of the hall, the third, at the rear, makes a beautiful study with doors opening onto the terrace and garden. The kitchen has been extended out at the rear and is well fitted with a range of modern storage units, granite worktops and integrated appliances. There is further scope to extend right across the back of the house now, connect to the study and add on a few hundred extra square feet in the process. Completing the layout of the ground floor is a further storeroom/large pantry off the kitchen with an additional basin, and a separate cloakroom/WC off the hall.</p><p></p><p>Below is a decent-size cellar, ideal for wine and with good head height. In our opinion, there are few locations where converting a basement is an obvious choice, but this is clearly one of them – the property’s amazing footprint, combined with the large rear garden makes undertaking such works (STPP) a thoroughly worthwhile investment here - the end result would, doubtless, be exceptional and the house’s total floor area, once completed, would almost certainly pass the 5000 sq ft mark.</p><p></p><p>The rear garden is a gem; gloriously sunny and with an open, southwesterly aspect over other large gardens and trees. Presently the upper terrace has artificial grass and a paved area for outside dining. This leads down a few steps into a very large lawned rear section, ideal for children.</p><p></p><p>All of the six double bedrooms are generous enough in size to dispense with any sibling altercations, although one has the added lure of a shower room en suite and another, the largest first floor bedroom, is currently used as a teenager TV/games room and has doors to the property’s full-width, front-facing balcony. The large principal suite on the top floor has a sumptuous bath/shower room and a wall of built-in wardrobes. There is also a third family bath/shower room on the first floor, with separate bath and shower cubicle. There are two loft spaces with hatch access, providing good storage and these may offer scope for further extension of the property within the roof space, possibly via mezzanines, subject to the usual consents. The utility room is cleverly positioned on the first floor close to the kids’ bedrooms.</p><p></p><p>The house is ideally located near to the Nightingale Lane end of this quiet, tree-lined and exclusive crescent, where parking tends to be plentiful. Clapham Common’s open spaces, tennis courts and other recreational facilities are 200m-300m away and the house is less than 500m from the Northern Line station at Clapham South which has frequent direct services to The City and West End. Wandsworth Common mainline station is a little over 800m away and has direct trains to Victoria. There is an established café/patisserie and a Sainsburys very close by on Nightingale Lane, with more extensive shopping facilities and a street market located nearby in Northcote Road, in Bellevue Road and at nearby Clapham South, whilst the Balham Waitrose is a short distance away in addition to the other main supermarkets. The area is also renowned for its wide choice of quality restaurants, bars and coffee houses. There is also an excellent selection of schools in the area for all age groups in both the private and state sectors.</p><p></p><br /><br />",51.45178,-0.155537,Detached,FREEHOLD,https://media.rightmove.co.uk/44k/43346/135664874/43346_26301439_IMG_00_0000.jpeg,house facade,house facade,"tensor([0.3999, 0.5283, 0.5358,  ..., 0.3064, 0.4395, 0.3183])"

Situated in the popular middle section of one of the area’s premier roads – a leafy location just off Wandsworth Common, close to excellent schools, transport facilities and both fashionable Northcote and Bellevue Roads.</p><p></p><p>Hendrick Avenue is situated between Thurleigh Road and Nightingale Lane in this highly-sought after position adjacent to Wandsworth Common and its mainline station and provides substantial Victorian family houses (built circa 1885) with good gardens. This example has been thoughtfully designed at the rear with a lovely light and spacious conservatory extension off the stylish kitchen. The kitchen itself is attractively fitted with smart units including a large stainless steel sink unit, hob and oven and has built-in walnut breakfast bar. The extension is a considerable addition to the generous reception areas and connects via double doors to a magnificent double drawing room with oak floors and lovely original features including fireplace, cornices and doors. When compared to the double-fronted houses in the local area, (which often have two sets of narrower rooms) these extra-wide single-fronted late-Victorian houses typically have wider rooms and a greater sense of space and light as a result. The usual downside is no separate area for children to enjoy. But this is not the case here as there is a well-defined and snug TV room (or study) off the hall and kitchen. It’s separate enough to be able to shut out the noise but close enough to the main living spaces (with window into the kitchen) to keep both parents and children happy. There’s also a useful ground floor cloakroom/ WC and decent wood panelled cellar with plumbing for the laundry appliances.</p><p></p><p>Upstairs the layout is again well thought out. The two rooms at the rear of the first floor have lovely views over the rear gardens and have been combined to create a delightful principal bedroom (with a wall of fitted wardrobes) and a beautifully appointed en suite bathroom. On the first floor to the front is another very large double bedroom with bay window, also with good fitted cupboards and an en suite shower room and which is therefore perfect for a nanny or for guests. The top floor provides three further double bedrooms and a family bathroom. There is also a generous storage loft. The garden is a delight; mainly lawned and with an easterly aspect. It is also especially open to the south which brings wonderful natural light into the kitchen area. At the same time there is an excellent feeling of seclusion from the rear with established climbers and neighbouring trees providing a lovely natural screen.</p><p></p><p>Hendrick Avenue is positioned at the southern end of this highly popular area known locally as “Between the Commons”. With houses built only on one side it feels more open than other nearby streets and parking is without doubt less of an issue. It is convenient for good schools such as Northcote Lodge, Honeywell, Thomas’, Belleville, and Broomwood Hall as well as numerous local nurseries. Transport is excellent, with Clapham South tube (Northern Line) and Wandsworth Common BR stations very accessible. The green spaces of both Wandsworth are also very close by. The ever-increasing range of specialist shops, bar/ restaurants and thriving street market on nearby Northcote Road, has dramatically increased its popularity as a shopping parade in recent years and there is a further selection on Bellevue Road’s pretty parade. High-street convenience shopping including numerous supermarkets can be found at Clapham South and Clapham Junction.</p><br /><br />",51.450255,-0.161528,Terraced,FREEHOLD,https://media.rightmove.co.uk/44k/43346/133114481/43346_26044001_IMG_00_0000.jpeg,house facade,house facade,"tensor([0.3695, 0.5688, 0.4933,  ..., 0.3501, 0.4595, 0.3084])"
